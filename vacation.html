<h3 class="heading">Dream vacation</h3>
	<p class="class2">I would like to roadtrip the entire country, using the Ultimate Road Trip. It is a map that follows a line throughout the whole country, going through each state in the U.S. I would like to do a lot of hiking in cool places, and spend as much time outdoors as I can. Ideally, this would be achievable, but with the recent gas prices.. not so much. But maybe some day.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A city in each state</li>
		<li>Ideally some of the bigger ones</li>
		<li>Maybe take detours to better cities</li>
	</ul>
